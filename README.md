Written in Swift 4, use a scrollable StackView (like UIScrollView). Your view controller can also subclass a StackViewController to manage the lifecycle of its StackView. Additionally if you need to colour its background or apply rotation on it or simply get it on a portion of your controller's view, this is the one library you need. Only Swift compatible.
